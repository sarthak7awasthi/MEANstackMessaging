# MEANstackMessaging

This web app allows users to post comments/messages and view them. I used Angular.js for the front end, Express.js & Node.js for the backend, and Mongoose for the database.

# How to run:

Open the backend folder in your terminal and run npm install and then run node server.js. This will start the server on localhost:3000. For the front end, open the front end folder in another terminal. Install the Angular CLI, and then run "ng serve". This will start the front end web app on localhost:4200. Make sure MongoDB is installed and running before starting the backend server.
